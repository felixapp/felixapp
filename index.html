        <p>Felix is a game for smartphone users that encourages weight loss through activity thereby improving health. The star of the app is a digital pet, the eponymous Felix, whose health is in the hands of the user. The app integrates with Apple HealthKit to track your steps throughout the day and rewards your activity with food for Felix. Food is used to keep Felix happy and healthy, otherwise he will perish. We hope Felix helps users stay aware of their daily activity and provides a stimulus to get up and move!</p>

<p>Felix is a behavioral health intervention aimed at combating the terrifying and costly obesity epidemic. According to NYC.gov more than 40% of children in New York Cityâ€™s public schools are overweight or obese, as well as 50% of adult New Yorkers. All of these individuals are at increased risk for a host of preventable disorders including; diabetes, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and cancer. Paired with education and a healthy diet, a critical intervention for stopping and reversing this epidemic is to get teens and adults to increase their daily amount of physical activity.</p>
